# EFundamentals Dev Code Challenge

The distance between two strings is given as the minimum number of operations needed to transform one string into the other with the allowable edit operations being insertion, deletion, or substitution of a single character.

**Problem**
1. Main challenge - Develop a small program that can calculate the distance between any 2
strings.
2. Extension - Develop a small web application that exposes this functionality as a REST web
service
